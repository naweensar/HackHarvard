# ðŸ¤” What is AIDERS
AIDERS is a real-time monitoring program powered by a vision model to detect emergency situations like falling and choking incidents in hospitals. The system aims to enhance patient safety by promptly alerting healthcare professionals when a patient is in distress.

**Related Tech:**

- Front end: Go, Handlebars, JavaScript, CSS HTML
- Back end: Python
- Visual model: YOLOv8
  
# ðŸš€ How does AIDERS help?

The main process of the AIDERS program:

1. **Human Movement Recognition**: Training a vision model based on datasets we build, it can recognize whether people get choked or fall over efficiently using the YOLOv8 training model.

2. **Emergency Treatment**: Once it detects an emergency situation, it will take a screenshot and send it to the doctor or your family with a short description via email and text message.

3. **Next Step**: After an emergency situation occurs, it will ask how the patient feels. If there is no response within 5 seconds, it will automatically contact the doctor or call 911.

# ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy Improvement

**Confidence Parameter**:
- For each emergency situation AIDERS detects, it will return a screenshot and a JSON file with the following format to the backend:

- The Confidence parameter measures how much the movements match models in our dataset. In case of frequent inaccurate reports, it will automatically filter out results with confidence less than 0.5.

- It will then send the screenshot to an LLM to ask whether there is a person who fell or got choked. After getting a positive answer, AIDERS will report it to doctors or the family.
